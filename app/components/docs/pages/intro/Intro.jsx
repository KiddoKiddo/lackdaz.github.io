    <p>
      Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio Page! I'm Seth, a web developer and I love building cool things online and sharing the inspiring work others are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a zealous reader of the New York Times, and it has served as the main source of inspiration for this webpage which I look to showcase my work, blog and share about social causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to make this a fun experience, so as you might have noticed that flashing button at bottom right of the screen, I've coded up a chatbot to walk you through this journey, unimaginatively named "Proto-Seth". Be nice to him.
