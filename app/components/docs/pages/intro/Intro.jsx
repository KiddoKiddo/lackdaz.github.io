    <p>
      My name is Seth Loh Wei Chen and Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer graduate from the General Assembly Web Development Immersive. I grew up in Singapore and graduated with a B.Soc.Sci.(Hons) in Economics from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and had worked previous stints as a data analyst, product development and logistics.

      I'm a zealous reader of the New York Times, and it has served as an immense source of inspiration for this webpage. I look to showcase my work, blog, share about social causes and engage with the online and offline tech community, and reach out to collaborators, prospects or friends of the internet.

      As you might have probably noticed that flashing button on the bottom right by now, I've coded up a chatbot to walk you through this journey, and I've uninspiringly named him "Proto-Seth". Be nice.
